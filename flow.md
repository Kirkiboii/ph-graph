# Development Flow Summary: ph-graph Project

This document summarizes the key steps and decisions made during the development of the `ph-graph` project, focusing on terminal animation experiments.

## Project Initialization and Initial Discussion

- The project `ph-graph` was introduced, with the goal of creating an ASCII rendering of an Obsidian-like graph view for the Helix editor welcome screen.
- Initial discussion revolved around the best way to render ASCII animations in the terminal, considering various languages and libraries:
    - **Python** (Curses, Rich)
    - **JavaScript/Node.js** (Blessed, Chalk, Ora)
    - **Go** (Termui, Gocui)
    - **Rust** (Crossterm, Tui-rs)
- Given the use of **Ghostty terminal with GPU acceleration**, **Rust with `crossterm` and `ratatui`** was recommended for its performance and control over the terminal.

## Experiment 1: Spinning Line Animation (`test-1` / `Spinning line`)

- A new Rust project was initialized in a subdirectory named `test-1` (later renamed to `Spinning line`).
- Dependencies `crossterm` and `ratatui` were added to `Cargo.toml`.
- A simple terminal application was developed to render an animated line spinning around its midpoint at 60 FPS.
- **Issues and Resolutions:**
    - **Compiler Errors:** Initial code had generic argument issues with `ratatui::Frame` and type inference. These were fixed by adjusting function signatures and removing unnecessary generics.
    - **"Vertical Oval" Appearance:** Due to terminal character aspect ratios, the circle appeared as a vertical oval. This was corrected by multiplying the x-coordinate by `2.0` in the `create_line` function to compensate.
    - **Responsiveness to Terminal Size:** The animation was made reactive to terminal width changes. The line's length was set to be `2/3` (and later `1/3`) of the terminal's width, dynamically adjusting on resize.
- **Runtime Environment Note:** It was clarified that "Gemini API errors" were not encountered; rather, Rust compiler errors and an OS-level runtime error (`Device not configured`) occurred due to the non-interactive nature of the execution environment, which were not issues for the user's local terminal.

## Experiment 2: Pulsing Line Animation (`test-2` / `Pulsing line`)

- A second Rust project was initialized in a subdirectory named `test-2` (later renamed to `Pulsing line`).
- `crossterm` and `ratatui` dependencies were added, ensuring the `edition = "2024"` was correctly maintained in `Cargo.toml` after an initial oversight.
- A terminal application was developed to render a horizontal line with an expanding pulse effect:
    - The pulse originates from one end, expands, and flows quickly to the other side, disappearing.
    - The animation runs at 60 FPS.
    - The pulse effect was refined to be wider and include a fading visual (using different ASCII characters like `█`, `▓`, `▒`, `░`).

## Directory Renaming

- The `test-1` directory was renamed to `Spinning line`.
- The `test-2` directory was renamed to `Pulsing line`.

This concludes the summary of the initial animation experiments.
